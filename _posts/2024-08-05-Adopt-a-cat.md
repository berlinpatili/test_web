Adopting a cat from Turkey and bringing it to Berlin involves several key steps to ensure the process is smooth and complies with all regulations. Here are the steps you need to follow:

Step-by-Step Guide
Adopt the Cat

Contact and choose a reputable adoption agency or animal shelter in Turkey.
Complete the necessary adoption paperwork and pay any required fees.
Prepare Travel Documents for the Cat

Microchip: Ensure the cat is microchipped with an ISO-compliant chip.
Vaccinations:
Rabies vaccination: The cat must be vaccinated against rabies at least 21 days before travel.
Other vaccinations such as feline distemper, rhinotracheitis, and calicivirus are also recommended.
Veterinary Health Certificate:
Obtain a health certificate from a licensed veterinarian in Turkey.
The certificate should state that the cat is healthy and fit to travel.
EU Pet Passport

Obtain an EU Pet Passport from a licensed veterinarian within the EU or an equivalent veterinary certificate from outside the EU.
Make Travel Arrangements

Airline Booking:
Check airlines that allow pets in the cabin or as checked baggage.
Book the flight and inform the airline that you will be traveling with a cat.
Pet Carrier:
Purchase an airline-approved pet carrier.
Ensure the carrier is comfortable and meets the size requirements of the airline.
Pre-Travel Preparations

Health Check: Have the cat examined by a vet a few days before traveling to ensure it is still fit to travel.
Feeding and Hydration: Feed the cat a light meal a few hours before the journey and ensure it is well-hydrated.
Comfort Items: Place a familiar blanket or toy in the carrier to comfort the cat during the journey.
Travel Day

Arrival at the Airport: Arrive at the airport early to allow time for the pet check-in process.
Security Check: Follow the airline’s instructions for the security check, which may require removing the cat from the carrier temporarily.
Upon Arrival in Berlin

Customs Clearance: Present the cat’s documents at customs. Be prepared to show the microchip, vaccination details, and health certificate.
Settling In: Once through customs, take the cat to its new home and allow it to adjust to the new environment slowly.
